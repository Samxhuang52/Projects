      "ITEM 1A.\tRISK FACTORSStatements in this Annual Report under the captions �Business� and �Management�s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,� as well as oral statements that may be made by us or by officers, directors or employees acting on our behalf, that are not historical fact constitute �forward-looking statements� within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth below.We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 17Table of ContentsWe will be required to raise additional funds to finance our operations and continue the development of our product candidates; we may not be able to do so when necessary, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us.Our operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash. Negative cash flows from our operations are expected to continue over at least the next several years. Our cash utilization amount is highly dependent on product development programs we choose to pursue, the progress of these product development programs, the results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory decisions regarding potential approval for our product candidates, the terms and conditions of our contracts with service providers for these programs, and the rate of recruitment of patients in our human clinical trials. In addition, the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of those studies and our financial resources at that time.We are pursuing forms of capital infusion including public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements with organizations that have capabilities, products and/or resources that are complementary to or could further extend our own capabilities, products or resources, in order to continue the development of our product candidates. However, there can be no assurances that we will complete any financings, strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements, and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to us.Based on our current operating plans, we expect our existing cash to support our operations into approximately the third quarter of 2017. We expect that our planned level of cash utilization will allow us to advance our ongoing programs, including completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of CA4P in patients with recurrent gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors with elevated biomarkers; the completion of the dose escalation portion of an open-label Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of OXi4503 in combination with cytarabine in patients with AML; supporting a Phase 1b/2 trial of CA4P in relapsed ovarian cancer in combination with pazopanib, which is being sponsored by two UK-based nonprofit organizations; and initiation and continuation of a phase 2/3 clinical trial of CA4P in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Any significant further clinical development of CA4P, including the completion of the planned Phase 2/3 clinical trial of CA4P in ovarian cancer, and of OXi4503 would be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital through public or private financings or from one or more new collaborative research or license agreements with a third-party, as to which we can give you no assurance.Our ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development; the costs of complying with U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other regulatory agency requirements; the progress of our research and development programs; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, undertaken by us; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations. We may seek to raise funds through public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements. Any additional equity or convertible debt financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize. Our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to raise additional capital could also be further impaired if our common shares lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market. 18Table of ContentsWe currently do not meet the continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market, which requires a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, which could result in our delisting and negatively impact the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets.Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. NASDAQ provides various continued listing requirements that a company must meet in order for its stock to continue trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Among these requirements is the requirement that the Company�s stock trades at a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. Our stock has recently traded below $1.00 per share, including closing bid prices below $1.00 per share. On December 1, 2015 we received a deficiency letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market which provided us a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until May 31, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, which would require a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. The NASDAQ letter also stated that we may be provided an additional 180 day compliance period if we demonstrate that we meet the applicable market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing and all other applicable standards for initial listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market (except the bid price requirement), and provide written notice of our intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency during the second grace period, including by implementation of a reverse stock split, if necessary. If we fail to qualify for the second grace period or fail to regain compliance during the second grace period, our stock will be subject to delisting by NASDAQ. Additionally, if we fail to comply with any other continued listing standards of NASDAQ, our common stock will also be subject to delisting. If that were to occur, our common stock would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock. This would significantly negatively affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would significantly negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock. Also, if we seek to implement a reverse stock split in order to remain listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, the announcement and/or implementation of a reverse stock split could significantly negatively affect the price of our common stock.Due in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates or those that are in-licensed, and/or we may be unable to pursue and complete the clinical trials that we would like to pursue and complete.We have limited technical, managerial and financial resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts related to our product candidates. Due to our limited available financial resources, we have curtailed clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates through the regulatory and development processes. Further, our planned clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is expected to be larger than any other clinical trial that we have conducted previously. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources to complete the trial, even if we are able to initiate it.We may make incorrect determinations with regard to the indications and clinical trials on which to focus the available resources that we do have. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish. We or our partners currently are pursuing clinical trials in various indications, but we are required by our financial resources to engage only in limited clinical activities. The decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources toward particular indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities. In addition, from time to time, we may in-license or otherwise acquire product candidates to supplement our internal development activities. Those activities may use resources that otherwise would have been devoted to our internal programs. We cannot assure you that any resources that we devote to acquired or in-licensed programs will result in any products that are superior to our internally developed products. 19Table of ContentsIf we are unable to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will be unable to market and sell our product candidates.Our product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing, oversight of clinical investigators, recordkeeping and commercialization. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review and approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United States, in the European Union and in many other foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be sold. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to unanticipated delays. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is unpredictable and often exceeds five years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the product candidate.In connection with the clinical development of our product candidates, we face risks that:  \t�\t \tthe product candidate may not prove to be safe and efficacious;  \t�\t \tpatients may die or suffer serious adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to the product candidate being tested;  \t�\t \twe fail to maintain adequate records of observations and data from our clinical trials, to establish and maintain sufficient procedures to oversee, collect data from, and manage clinical trials, or to monitor clinical trial sites and investigators to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agencies;  \t�\t \twe may not have sufficient financial resources to complete the clinical trials that would be necessary to obtain regulatory approvals;  \t�\t \tthe results of later-phase clinical trials may not confirm the results of earlier clinical trials; and  \t�\t \tthe results from clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or clinical benefit-to-risk ratio required by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval.Only a small percentage of product candidates for which clinical trials are initiated are the subject of NDAs and even fewer receive approval for commercialization. Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market a product candidate, any such approval may be subject to limitations such as those on the indicated uses for which we may market the product.We may seek orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates in additional indications, and we may be unsuccessful.Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. To date, we have been granted orphan drug designation for CA4P for the treatment of ovarian cancer and for OXi4503 for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, in the United States and the European Union.Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication during the period of exclusivity. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective, if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 20Table of ContentsEven if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a different drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.If we or the third parties on which we rely for the conduct of our clinical trials and results do not perform our clinical trial activities in accordance with good clinical practices and related regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.We currently use independent clinical investigators in all of our clinical trials and, in many cases, also utilize contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third-party service providers to conduct and/or oversee the clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials. Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the FDA�s requirements and our general investigational plan and protocol. Currently, we have clinical trial activities involving CA4P and OXi4503 being conducted by clinical investigators who are independent of us, but with whom we have agreements for them to provide the results of their clinical trials to us. In order for us to rely on data from these ongoing clinical trials in support of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for approval of any of our product candidates by the FDA or similar types of marketing applications that are required by other regulatory authorities, the independent investigators are required to comply with applicable good clinical practice requirements.The FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities require us and our clinical investigators to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting and recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or the respective trial plans and protocols. The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates or result in enforcement action against us.In February 2012, we were inspected by the FDA, and in March 2012, we received a Form FDA 483 containing observations from that inspection. The Form FDA 483 noted observations of certain GCP deficiencies in the conduct of our FACT Study in ATC, which was conducted from July 2007 to February 2010. These observations included the failure to ensure proper monitoring of third-party clinical investigators who were participants in our FACT Study, the failure to promptly bring non-compliant clinical investigators into compliance. The FDA also found that some of the clinical trial monitors selected by our CROs outside the United States were not sufficiently qualified by experience and training to monitor clinical trials. The Form FDA 483 also included observations related to the failure to address the improper storage of a drug that was being used in the trial, and the failure to maintain records and case histories in compliance with FDA regulations. The issues noted in the Form FDA 483 had previously been identified and addressed by our management as part of an internal review of our systems, practices and procedures governing the areas of vendor oversight, quality, and regulatory compliance. Our response to the Form FDA 483 described the corrective actions that we had taken and will continue to take in response to this matter. On February 10, 2014, we received correspondence from the FDA informing us that we appeared to have taken corrective action to prevent the recurrence of the conditions that led to the issuance of the Form FDA 483 and that the related inspection was closed.While we have taken and continue to take steps to strengthen our procedures in order to ensure that these and similar issues will not recur in any future clinical trials sponsored by us for any of our product candidates, we cannot assure you that the FDA will be satisfied with our procedures, and that the FDA will not issue additional 483 observations or warning letters or take other enforcement action against us in the future. The steps we take to strengthen our procedures and conduct future clinical trials necessary for approval will be time-consuming and expensive. 21Table of ContentsWe may encounter difficulties in expanding our operations successfully if and when we evolve from a company that is primarily involved in clinical development to a company that is also involved in commercialization.As we advance our product candidates through later stages of clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with such third parties, as well as additional collaborators, distributors, marketers and suppliers.Maintaining third party relationships for these purposes will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management and other personnel. We must be able to manage our development efforts effectively, manage our participation in the clinical trials in which our product candidates are involved effectively, and improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.If, following any approval of our product candidates, we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing or distribution services, any product revenues that we receive, or the profitability of these product revenues to us, are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our products or in doing so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products.If we were to submit an NDA for our drug candidates in the United States or a marketing application in the EU, we would need to undertake commercial scale manufacturing activities at significant expense to us in order to proceed with the application for approval for commercialization. We or our external vendors may encounter technical difficulties that preclude us from successfully manufacturing the required registration and validation batches of active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and/or drug product and we may be unable to recover any financial losses associated with the manufacturing activities. Further, our research or product development efforts may not be successfully completed, any compounds currently under development by us may not be successfully developed into drugs, any potential products may not receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all, and competitors may develop and bring to market products or technologies that render our potential products obsolete. If any of these problems occur, our business would be materially and adversely affected.We have no manufacturing capacity and have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates.We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates or any of the compounds that we are testing in our preclinical programs, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to do so. As a result, we currently rely, and we expect to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party manufacturers to supply our product candidates. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves, including:  \t�\t \treliance on third-parties for manufacturing process development, regulatory compliance and quality assurance;  \t�\t \tlimitations on supply availability resulting from capacity and scheduling constraints of third-parties;  \t�\t \tthe possible breach of manufacturing agreements by third-parties because of factors beyond our control; and  \t�\t \tthe possible termination or non-renewal of the manufacturing agreements by the third-party, at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us.If we do not maintain our developed important manufacturing relationships, we may fail to find replacement manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, which could delay or impair our ability to obtain 22Table of Contentsregulatory approval for our products and substantially increase our costs or deplete profit margins, if any. If we do find replacement manufacturers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us, and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities.The FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities. The FDA and corresponding foreign regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. Contract manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing drug substance production and shipment delays or a situation where the contractor may not be able to maintain compliance with the applicable cGMP requirements. Any failure to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to develop our product candidates and market our products after approval.Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our ability to develop our product candidates, our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval and our potential future profit margins on these products.Our product candidates have not completed clinical trials, and may never demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in order to do so.Our product candidates are in the clinical stage of development. In order to achieve profitable operations, we alone or in collaboration with others, must successfully develop, manufacture, introduce and market our products. The time frame necessary to achieve market success for any individual product is long and uncertain. The products currently under development by us may require significant additional research and development and additional preclinical and clinical testing prior to application for commercial use. A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after showing promising results in early or later-stage studies or clinical trials. Although we have obtained some favorable results to date in preclinical studies and clinical trials of certain of our potential products, such results may not be indicative of results that will ultimately be obtained in or throughout such clinical trials, and clinical trials may not show any of our products to be safe or capable of producing a desired result. Additionally, we may encounter problems in our clinical trials that may cause us to delay, suspend or terminate those clinical trials.Our product candidates have been tested in over 450 patients to date, and adverse events associated with CA4P and OXi4503 have been found to be mainly low grade, reversible, transient and manageable. However, we will be required to continue to test and evaluate the safety of our product candidates in additional clinical trials, and to demonstrate their safety to the satisfaction of appropriate regulatory agencies, as a condition to receipt of any regulatory approvals. In clinical trials to date, transient mild to moderate hypertension believed to be associated with CA4P and OXi4503 has been effectively managed through pre-treatment with anti-hypertensive medication. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to make the necessary demonstrations of safety to allow us to receive regulatory approval for our product candidates in any indication.We only have a limited number of employees to manage and operate our business.As of March 23, 2016, we had a total of 15 full-time employees. Our focus on reducing cash utilization requires us to manage and operate our business in a highly efficient manner. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.We have a history of losses, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.We have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2015, had an accumulated deficit of over $264 million. We anticipate continuing to incur substantial additional losses over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, our continuing clinical trials and development activities with respect to our VDA drug candidates, technologies, and anticipated research and development activities and the general and administrative expenses associated with those activities. We have not yet commercialized any 23Table of Contentsproduct candidates. Our ability to attain profitability will depend upon our ability to develop and commercialize products that are effective and commercially viable, to obtain regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of our products and to license or otherwise market our products successfully. We may never achieve profitability.We depend on our executive officers and principal consultants and the loss of their services could materially harm our business.We believe that our success depends, and will likely continue to depend, upon our ability to retain the services of our current executive officers, principal consultants and others. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we have established relationships with universities, hospitals and research institutions, which have historically provided, and continue to provide, us with access to research laboratories, clinical trials, facilities and patients. Additionally, we believe that we may, at any time and from time to time, materially depend on the services of consultants and other unaffiliated third parties. We cannot assure you that consultants and other unaffiliated third parties will provide the level of service to us that we require in order to achieve our business objectives.Our industry is highly competitive, and our product candidates may become obsolete.We are engaged in a rapidly evolving field. Competition from other pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions is intense and likely to increase. Many of those companies and institutions have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Many of those companies and institutions also have substantially greater experience in developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do. Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products. We are aware of at least four other companies that currently have a clinical-stage VDA for use in an oncology indication. Some of these competitive products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the desired therapeutic effect than products being developed by us. Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective and/or cost competitive than those we are developing, or that would render our product candidates less competitive or even obsolete. In addition, one or more of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we do, which could materially adversely affect us.We depend extensively on the patents and proprietary technology we license from others, and we must maintain these licenses in order to preserve our business.We have licensed in rights to CA4P, OXi4503 and other programs from third parties. If our license agreements terminate or expire, we may lose the licensed rights to our product candidates, including CA4P and OXi4503, and we may not be able to continue to develop them or, if they are approved, we may not be able to market or commercialize them.We depend on license agreements with third-parties for certain intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates, including patent rights. Currently, we have licensed in certain patent rights from Arizona State University, or ASU, and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company for CA4P and OXi4503, with Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for certain uses of CA4P and OXi4503, and from Baylor University for other programs. In general, our license agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations in order to keep these agreements in effect and retain our rights under them. These payment obligations can include upfront fees, maintenance fees, milestones, royalties, patent prosecution expenses, and other fees. These performance obligations typically include diligence obligations. If we fail to pay, be diligent or otherwise perform as required under our license agreements, we could lose the rights under the patents and other intellectual property rights covered by the agreements. While we are not currently aware of any dispute with any licensors under our material agreements with them, if disputes arise under any of our in-licenses, including our in-licenses from ASU, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Baylor University and Angiogene Pharmaceuticals Ltd., we could lose our rights under these agreements. Any such dispute may not be resolvable on favorable terms, or at all. Whether or not any disputes of this kind are favorably resolved, our management�s time and attention and our other resources could be consumed by the need to attend to and seek to resolve these disputes and our business could be harmed by the emergence of such a dispute. 24Table of ContentsIf we lose our rights under these agreements, we may not be able to conduct any further activities with the product candidate or program that the license covered. If this were to happen, we might not be able to develop our product candidates further, or following regulatory approval, if any, we might be prohibited from marketing or commercializing them. In particular, patents previously licensed to us might after termination be used to stop us from conducting these activities.We depend extensively on our patents and proprietary technology and patents and proprietary technology we license from others, and we must protect those assets in order to preserve our business.Although we expect to seek patent protection for any compounds we discover and/or for any specific use we discover for new or previously known compounds, any or all of them may not be subject to effective patent protection. Further, the development of regimens for the administration of pharmaceuticals, which generally involve specifications for the frequency, timing and amount of dosages, has been, and we believe, may continue to be, important to our effort, although those processes, as such, may not be patentable. In addition, the issued patents may be declared invalid or our competitors may find ways to avoid the claims in the patents.Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We are the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee on a number of granted United States patents, pending United States patent applications, and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan. The patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us is generally highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions, resulting in both an apparent inconsistency regarding the breadth of claims allowed in United States patents and general uncertainty as to their legal interpretation and enforceability. Accordingly, patent applications assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not result in patents being issued, any issued patents assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not provide us with competitive protection or may be challenged by others, and the current or future granted patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business and achieve profitability. Moreover, because some of the basic research relating to one or more of our patent applications and/or patents were performed at various universities and/or funded by grants, one or more of these universities, employees of such universities and/or grantors could assert that they have certain rights in such research and any resulting products. Further, others may independently develop similar products, may duplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights. In addition, as a result of the assertion of rights by a third-party or otherwise, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of others in or outside of the United States. Any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in product market introductions while our attempts to design around such patents or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us or in connection with patents to which we hold licenses or in bringing suit to protect our own patents against infringement.We require employees and the institutions that perform our preclinical and clinical trials to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. Those agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to a party to any such agreement during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third-parties, except in specific circumstances. Any such agreement may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.The use of our products may result in product liability exposure, and it is uncertain whether our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all claims.The use of our product candidates in clinical trials may expose us to liability claims in the event such product candidates cause death, injury or disease, or result in adverse effects. We may be exposed to liability claims even if our product did not cause death, injury or diseases, but is merely presumed or alleged to have caused any of these. If our product candidates are ever commercially approved, the commercial use of these products may also expose us to similar liability claims. Any of these claims could be made by health care institutions, contract laboratories, patients or others using such products. Although we have obtained liability 25Table of Contentsinsurance coverage for our ongoing clinical trials, this coverage may not be in amounts sufficient to protect us from any product liability claims or product recalls which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects. Further, adverse product and similar liability claims could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our technology and product candidates under development.If clinical trials or regulatory approval processes for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or suspended, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any revenue from potential product sales.We cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials or delay the analysis of data derived from them. A number of events, including any of the following, could delay the completion of our other ongoing and planned clinical trials and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell, a particular product candidate:  \t�\t \tconditions imposed on us by the FDA, EMA or another foreign regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;  \t�\t \tdelays in obtaining, or our inability to obtain, required approvals from institutional review boards or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;  \t�\t \tinsufficient supply of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct and complete our clinical trials;  \t�\t \tslow enrollment and retention rate of subjects in clinical trials;  \t�\t \tany compliance audits and pre-approval inspections by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities;  \t�\t \tnegative or inconclusive results from clinical trials, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results;  \t�\t \tserious and unexpected drug-related side effects; and  \t�\t \tfailure of our third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations to us.Commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed by the imposition of additional conditions on our clinical trials by the FDA, EMA or another foreign regulatory authority or the requirement of additional supportive clinical trials by the FDA, EMA or another foreign regulatory authority. In addition, clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the conduct of other clinical trials that compete for the same patients as our clinical trials, and the eligibility criteria for our clinical trials. Our failure to enroll patients in our clinical trials could delay the completion of the clinical trial beyond our expectations. In addition, the FDA and EMA could require us to conduct clinical trials with a larger number of subjects than we have projected for any of our product candidates. We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely or cost-effective manner. Furthermore, enrolled patients may drop out of our clinical trials, which could impair the validity or statistical significance of the clinical trials.We do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Delays in our clinical trials will result in increased development costs for our product candidates, and our financial resources may be insufficient to fund any incremental costs. In addition, if our clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be limited. 26Table of ContentsOur product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with continuing regulations, we could lose these approvals and the sale of any approved commercial products could be suspended.Even if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA, EMA and other applicable domestic and foreign regulatory authorities or previously unknown problems with any approved product, manufacturer, or manufacturing process are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:  \t�\t \trestrictions on the products, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes;  \t�\t \twarning letters;  \t�\t \tcivil or criminal penalties;  \t�\t \tfines;  \t�\t \tinjunctions;  \t�\t \tproduct seizures or detentions;  \t�\t \tpressure to initiate voluntary product recalls;  \t�\t \tsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals; and  \t�\t \trefusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.If physicians and patients do not accept our future products or if the market for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.Even if any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payers. Physicians may decide not to recommend our drugs for a variety of reasons including:  \t�\t \ttiming of market introduction of competitive products;  \t�\t \tdemonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;  \t�\t \tcost-effectiveness;  \t�\t \tlimited or no coverage by third-party payers;  \t�\t \tconvenience and ease of administration;  \t�\t \tprevalence and severity of adverse side effects;  \t�\t \trestrictions in the label of the drug;  \t�\t \tother potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and  \t�\t \tineffective marketing and distribution support of our products.If any of our product candidates is approved, but fails to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer. 27Table of ContentsThe uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical reimbursement and related matters may adversely affect our business.Market acceptance and sales of any one or more of our product candidates that we develop will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will cover and establish payment levels. We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for any product candidates that we develop. Also, we cannot be certain that reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs.The United States and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any products that we develop due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals.In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, ACA, became law in the U.S. The goal of ACA is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers. While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we may charge for, any products we develop that receive regulatory approval. We also cannot predict the impact of ACA on us as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, which have not yet been fully implemented.Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. Global financial concerns have caused, and may continue to cause, extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. We cannot currently anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures.Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Furthermore, we have little or no control over the security measures and computer systems of our third-party CROs and other contractors and consultants. While we have not experienced any material system failure, accident, or security 28Table of Contentsbreach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data for our product candidates could result in delays in our marketing approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.Our employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.We are exposed to the risk that our employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate the regulations of the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities; healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad; or laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or creating fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation.We have a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.We, or the third parties upon whom we depend, may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.The price of our common stock is volatile, and is likely to continue to fluctuate due to reasons beyond our control.The market price of our common stock has been, and likely will continue to be, highly volatile. Factors, including our financial results or our competitors� financial results, clinical trial and research development announcements and government regulatory action affecting our potential products in both the United States and foreign countries, have had, and may continue to have, a significant effect on our results of operations and on the 29Table of Contentsmarket price of our common stock. We cannot assure you that an investment in our common stock will not fluctuate significantly. One or more of these factors could significantly harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our common stock in the public market. Substantially all of the shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants have been registered for resale or are available for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and may be sold from time to time. Such sales, as well as future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, or the perception that sales may occur at any time, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot maintain effective controls and reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed. For example, during the third quarter of 2013, our management determined that we had a material weakness related to the operation of our controls over financial reporting associated with a complex non-routine financing transaction in the second quarter of 2013. We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 based on the criteria established in Internal Control � Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015. We continue to work on improvements to our internal controls over financial reporting; however, there can be no assurance that another material weakness will not occur in the future. Any failure to implement and maintain controls over our financial reporting or difficulties encountered in the implementation of improvements in our controls, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to improve our internal controls over financial reporting or to address identified weaknesses in the future, if they were to occur, could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock.Issuance of additional equity securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.We are currently authorized to issue up to 70,000,000 shares of our common stock and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 26,545,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, and we had no shares of preferred stock outstanding. As of December 31, 2015, we also had approximately 9,842,000 warrants and 2,031,000 options outstanding.To the extent that shares of common stock are issued or options and warrants are exercised, holders of our common stock will experience dilution. In addition, in the event of any future issuances of equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, holders of our common stock may experience dilution.Moreover, our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, conversion rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decrease. Any provision permitting the conversion of any such preferred stock into our common stock could result in significant dilution to the holders of our common stock.We also consider from time to time various strategic alternatives that could involve issuances of additional common stock, including but not limited to acquisitions and business combinations, but do not currently have any definitive plans to enter into any of these transactions. 30Table of ContentsWe have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, and you may not receive funds without selling your common stock.We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, nor do we expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings, if any, to finance our operations and growth and, potentially, for future stock repurchases and, therefore, we have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, any contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash from your investment in OXiGENE, Inc. You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell our common stock and may lose the entire amount of your investment.ITEM 7.\tMANAGEMENT�S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur management�s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or outcomes to be materially different from those anticipated and discussed herein. Important factors that we believe may cause such differences are discussed in the �Risk Factors� section of this Annual Report and in the �Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995� section of this Annual Report. In assessing forward-looking statements contained herein, readers are urged to read carefully all Risk Factors and cautionary statements contained in this Annual Report. Further, we operate in an industry sector where securities prices are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control.We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of vascular disrupting agents, or VDAs, for the treatment of cancer. VDAs selectively target the vasculature of cancer tumors and obstruct a tumor�s blood supply without disrupting the blood supply to normal tissues. Treatment with VDAs has been shown to lead to significant central tumor necrosis, which refers to the death of cancer cells.VDAs are in a class of drugs called vascular targeted therapies, or VTTs, which also includes anti-angiogenic agents, or AAs. Bevacizumab and other currently approved AA drugs work by preventing the growth of new blood vessels which can supply nutrients to tumor cells. We are seeking to realize the full potential of VTTs in oncology by using the combination of VDAs and AAs to treat cancer tumors. The aim of using a VDA and an AA in combination, is for the VDA to directly cut-off the blood supply to the interior of the tumor, while the AA indirectly inhibits angiogenesis, which is the process by which new blood vessels form and re-vascularize the tumor. Our current VDA development plans are focused on this combination so that the mechanism of action of each drug would complement that of the other � disrupting tumor blood supply in two different ways instead of just one.We have two clinical stage investigational drugs, both VDAs, that we are currently developing � CA4P and OXi4503. Our lead compound is CA4P. The largest clinical trial of CA4P conducted to date was a recent phase 2 clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer sponsored by the Gynecologic Oncology Group, or GOG, which was completed in 2014 and met its primary endpoint by demonstrating an improvement in progression-free survival for the patients who received CA4P. This trial, referred to as GOG-0186I, compared treatment with CA4P plus bevacizumab to treatment with bevacizumab alone. Based on the positive results of this clinical trial, we are initiating a phase 2/3 clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, which will compare treatment with CA4P, bevacizumab and chemotherapy to treatment with bevacizumab and chemotherapy. CA4P is also being studied in combination with pazopanib in an on-going phase 1b/2 clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer that is sponsored by The Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom. Our second compound, OXi4503, is being studied in combination with cytarabine in a phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).During 2015, our resources were focused primarily on evaluating the potential clinical pathway for CA4P in ovarian cancer after receiving in late 2014 the positive results from a phase 2 clinical trial in ovarian cancer conducted by the GOG, evaluating other potential indications for CA4P and the approval pathways for these indications, planning a registration grade phase 2/3 clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, continuation of our phase 2 clinical trial testing of CA4P in neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs, and supporting the phase 1b/2 clinical trial of CA4P in combination with pazopanib in advanced recurrent ovarian cancer that is being conducted in the 32Table of ContentsU.K. We also brought in-house an on-going clinical trial of OXi4503 in AML that was previously being conducted by an investigator at a single site, and moved this trial into its combination treatment phase.In 2014 and earlier years, we focused our capital resources on completing clinical trials of CA4P for various indications and other work related to the development of this investigational drug candidate. These activities included supporting the CA4P ovarian cancer phase 2 clinical trial conducted by the GOG, the investigator-sponsored OXi4503 phase 1 clinical trial in AML, our distribution agreement for the compassionate use of CA4P in anaplastic thyroid cancer, or ATC, in Europe, and the manufacture of CA4P for subsequent clinical trials. We have also focused capital resources on completing our ATC trial, or the FACT Study, completing our non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, trial, or the FALCON Study, as well as completing other clinical trials, mostly using CA4P as a single agent, in solid tumors, NSCLC, head and neck cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, advanced gastrointestinal carcinoma and certain ocular indications.Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and EstimatesThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time we make such estimates. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report.We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. We believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments are the following:Research and development expensesResearch and development expenses consist of costs we incur for the development of our investigational drugs and for preclinical research activities. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include salaries and benefits of employees, including associated stock-based compensation, payments to clinical investigators, drug manufacturing costs, laboratory supplies and facility costs. Clinical trial costs can be a significant component of our research and development expenses, and these can be difficult to accurately estimate. Included in clinical trial costs are fees paid to other entities that conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf, such as clinical research organizations, or CROs. We estimate clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions such as CROs and the actual clinical investigators. These estimates are based on actual time and expenses incurred by the CRO and the clinical investigators. Also included in clinical trial expenses are costs based on the level of patient enrollment into the clinical trial and the actual services performed under the related clinical trial agreement. Changes in clinical trial assumptions, such as the length of time estimated to enroll all patients, rate of screening failures, patient drop-out rates, number and nature of adverse event reports and the total number of patients enrolled can impact the average and expected cost per patient and the overall cost of the clinical trial. Based on patient enrollment reports and services provided, we may periodically adjust estimates for the clinical trial costs. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed, the length of time for these services or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. Although we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of clinical trial accruals to date, investors should be aware that our planned clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is expected to be larger than any other clinical trial that we have conducted previously. 33Table of ContentsShare-based compensationWe record the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees and other service providers. The valuation of stock options is an inherently subjective process, since market values are not available for long-term, non-transferable stock options in our equity securities. Accordingly, we use a Black-Scholes option pricing model to derive an estimated fair value of the stock options which we issue. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires certain input assumptions, including the expected term of the options and the expected volatility of our common stock. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value that we record for share-based payments that we issue. We determine the term of the options based on the simplified method, which averages the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock option. We determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option�s expected term. The Black-Scholes option pricing model also requires assumptions for risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock, but we feel that these values are more objective and note that changes in these values do not have a significant impact on the estimated value of the options when compared to the volatility and term assumptions.We are also required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, we perform a historical analysis of option awards that are forfeited prior to vesting, and record total stock option expense that reflects this estimated forfeiture rate.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYears ended December 31, 2015 and 2014Research and Development expensesThe table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated and provides the amount and percentage change in these components (in thousands):  In 2015 compared to 2014, total research and development expenses increased primarily due to higher external clinical trial costs related to the development of our VDAs as potential new treatments for cancer and higher employee-related costs resulting from additional personnel as we refocused the Company on clinical development. These increases were partially offset by lower drug manufacturing expenses since the drug product required for our 2015 clinical programs was manufactured in 2014.The increase in clinical studies expense for 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to contract research organization costs related to our ongoing clinical trials. Clinical studies expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations who conduct clinical trials on our behalf, patient and clinical site costs, laboratory costs and other services directly related to clinical trials. The increase in 2015 is primarily due to planning and preparation for our upcoming phase 2/3 of CA4P in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, fees paid to contract research organizations managing our CA4P NET phase 2 trial initiated in 2014, and to a lesser extent our OXi4503 AML phase 1b/2 trial that we brought in-house in 2015. Patient costs also contributed to the increase in clinical study costs as most of the CA4P NET phase 2 patient enrollment occurred in 2015. 34Table of ContentsDrug manufacturing expenses consist primarily of costs paid to third-party manufacturers for production of our investigational drugs. These manufacturing costs decreased for 2015 compared to 2014 due to our production of substantially less CA4P drug product in 2015, as we fulfilled 2015�s CA4P drug supply requirements in 2014. Timing of drug manufacturing costs is variable and is impacted by the timing of when drug product is needed for clinical trials, product expiration or re-test requirements, potential regulatory filings and scheduling of production batches based on the drug manufacturer�s generally long lead time requirements.The increase in consulting and professional services for 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to a full evaluation that we undertook of our entire CA4P program in 2015, including evaluation of various potential indications.Employee compensation and related expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to our hiring of additional research and development personnel to support our current and planned clinical programs for CA4P and OXi4503. For the same reason, employee stock-based compensation increased in 2015 compared to 2014.Other expenses include facility related expenses and licensing fees which decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower licensing fees paid for rights to our drug product candidates.Because we plan to initiate a phase 2/3 clinical study of CA4P in platinum resistant ovarian cancer during the first half of 2016 and conduct additional clinical development of our investigational drugs, we expect research and development expenses to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015.General and administrative expensesThe table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated and the amount and percentage change in these components (in thousands): For 2015 compared to 2014, total general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower consulting and professional services, and, to a lesser extent, lower employee costs.Employee compensation and related expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to greater severance expense recorded in 2014. During 2014, our severance costs were related to the departure of our former CEO, and although there were severance costs related to another employee in 2015, the amount of those costs was lower. The decrease in employee severance costs for 2015 compared to 2014 was partially offset by higher compensation costs and related expenses due to our making several positions full time during 2015 that were less than full time in 2014.Changes in employee stock-based compensation were not significant between the periods presented.Consulting and professional services expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to reduced marketing, research and legal costs.Other expenses, which include facility related expenses and insurance expenses, decreased for 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower fees paid in several different areas, none of which were individually significant.Although general and administrative expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2016 to support our planned increase in research and development, as well as for additional business development and investor relations efforts. 35Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe are developing two investigational drugs, both VDAs, for the treatment of cancer and currently have no sources of revenue. We measure liquidity by the cash and other capital we have available to fund our operations, which are primarily focused on the advancement of our VDAs. To date, we have financed our operations principally through net proceeds received from the sale of equity, including $9.2 million in 2015 and $35.2 million in 2014, and at one point through a strategic development arrangement which concluded in 2009. We have experienced net losses in each year since our inception, and negative cash flow from operations in nearly every year also. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of over $264 million, including a net loss of approximately $13.7 million in 2015, and cash of approximately $27.3 million, which we expect to be sufficient to fund our operations into the third quarter of 2017. We expect to continue to incur expenses, resulting in losses and negative cash flows from operations, over at least the next several years as we continue to develop our candidate drugs for the treatment of cancer.We expect to incur significant additional costs over at least the next several years as a result of our plans to develop VDAs for the treatment of cancer, including continuing our existing clinical trials as well as conducting new, additional clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures. We anticipate that our development will include continuing our current clinical trials as well as new clinical trials and additional research and development expenditures.We will require additional capital before we can complete all planned clinical trials and development of CA4P and OXi4503. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to access additional funds when needed, we may not be able to continue the development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and operations. Any additional equity financing, if available, may not be available on favorable terms, would most likely be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. If we are able to access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own, on terms that are not favorable to us.We have filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, covering the sale from time to time of shares of our common stock and other securities, which may provide us the opportunity to raise funds when we consider it necessary or appropriate, at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offering. However, pursuant to the instructions to Form S-3, we only have the ability to sell shares under the shelf registration statement, during any 12-month period, in an amount less than or equal to one-third of the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates. Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to raise additional capital could also be further impaired if we are unable to comply with the listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market and our stock trades elsewhere.Contractual ObligationsThe following table presents information regarding our non-cancelable contractual obligations, which consists of our facility lease, as of December 31, 2015:  36Table of ContentsOur primary drug development programs are based on a series of natural products called combretastatins. In August 1999, we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by Arizona State University, or ASU. This agreement was subsequently amended in June 2002. From the inception of the ASU license agreement through December 31, 2015, we have paid a total of $2,700,000 in connection with this license. The ASU license agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals. The ASU license agreement also provides for additional payments upon our election to develop certain additional compounds, as defined in the ASU license agreement. We are also required to pay royalties on future net sales of products associated with these patent rights. Either party may terminate the ASU license agreement upon material default or bankruptcy of the other party. In addition, we may terminate the agreement by either (i) determining that filing for regulatory approval is not warranted or economically feasible by the clinical testing date or (ii) by providing two months written notice of our intent to terminate the agreement.We also have an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including CA4P. BMS granted this license to us in February of 2002 in connection with the termination of a prior research collaboration and license agreement by and between BMS and us. Under the BMS license, we have the right to grant sublicenses, and BMS is entitled to low-single-digit royalty payments for commercial sales of products related to these licensed patent rights plus any remuneration we receive for sale of CA4P under named patient or compassionate use programs. All licensing fees and milestone payments under the BMS license have been paid. We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the BMS license and have a right, but not a duty, of enforcing patents covered by the license. Either party may terminate the BMS license upon material default of the other party. \n"
